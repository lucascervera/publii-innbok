<h2 id="your-business-model-info-in-one-place">Your business model info in one place</h2>
<p>InnBoK Modeler centralizes your business model information in one place, avoiding data dispersion across multiple files on your hard drive (a PowerPoint with your Business Model Canvas, a PDF with your Value Proposition Canvas, an Excel file with your competitive analysis). This facilitates the update, maintenance, and visualization of the components of the business model in different contexts. Work with the tools you know, such as the Business Model Canvas, to input information and adapt it to your business needs.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-and-documentation">Methodology and documentation</h2>
<p>InnBoK Modeler is based on popular innovation methodologies, such as Lean Startup, Customer Development, and Design Thinking, integrating them and avoiding overlaps. Additionally, it provides the information you need at each moment to follow the process of creating your business model. It is fully integrated with the InnBoK methodology, which explains step by step who should do what, how, and when.</p>
<p>It facilitates the complete cycle of design, analysis, and validation of your business model systematically and dynamically.</p>
<h2 id="task-prioritization-and-experimentation">Task prioritization and experimentation</h2>
<p>InnBoK Modeler offers templates that fit your project. If your project, for example, is an e-commerce, you donâ€™t have to start from a blank canvas. Instead, you can use a template and customize it.</p>
<p>It also provides preloaded content. For example, when identifying the channels you will use to reach your customers, it provides an extensive list for you to incorporate into your business model without starting from scratch.</p>
<p>Our platform facilitates the management of tasks related to your business model, helping you prioritize work and experiments efficiently. Focus on the tasks that most contribute to maximizing the chances of success for your business.</p>
<h2 id="exportable-and-expandable">Exportable and expandable</h2>
<p>Use InnBoK Modelerâ€™s content to communicate your business model to employees, investors, and other stakeholders. Easily export your model in web, PDF, or image format.</p>
<h2 id="based-on-logseq-and-open-source">Based on LogSeq and open source</h2>
<p>LogSeq is a note-taking and knowledge management tool that provides a structured and interconnected approach to organizing information and creating a network of linked notes. LogSeq allows users to create and link together blocks of text, create bi-directional links between related ideas, and navigate their notes in a non-linear manner. It uses Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows users to format their notes using plain text syntax. LogSeq is designed to be a local-first application, which means that users have full control over their data, and their notes are stored locally on their devices. As an open-source project, LogSeq is actively developed and maintained by a community of contributors. InnBoK applies this approach to business modeling.</p>
